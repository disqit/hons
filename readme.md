# ðŸ”Ž AdAnalysis ðŸ”Ž

If you're reading this, it's assumed you have downloaded the .zip or complete repository from the GitHub page. If not, go [download it](https://github.com/jbofa/hons-project) before proceeding.

This software is only compatible with the desktop Chrome web browser as it works as a browser extension, so you'll also need Chrome before proceeding.


## Installation and setup

 1. Unzip the files into a folder if they are compressed, or make sure the downloaded repository is in one folder by itself.
 2. Open the Chrome browser. Click on the "**â‹®**" button in the top right corner. Go to *More Tools > Extensions*.
 3. In the Extensions screen, enable "Developer Mode" mode in the top right corner. This should enable the "Load unpacked" and two other buttons.
 4. Click the "Load unpacked" button. A folder selection window should popup.
 5. Navigate to the folder that contains the unzipped files or repository. Once here, click the "Select Folder" button. *Note: you are not selecting a file, only a folder.*
 6. The extension should have been installed.

## Using the tool

 1. Navigate to a page that you wish to analyse. Let it load.
 2. Depending on your Chrome configuration, you will find one of two layouts to access the AdAnalysis extension:\
		 a) The extension is directly accessible, with the magnifying glass icon to the right of the URL bar.\
		 b) The extension is accessible under the puzzle piece icon that lists all your extensions, to the right of the URL bar. Clicking this reveals all your extensions. Click the 'AdAnalysis' extension with the magnifying glass icon.
3. When you click the icon to activate the tool, a mini window will popup. Simply click the "Scan page" button. 
4. Do not click away from the mini window during scanning. It will take a few seconds, depending on the page content. The result will appear once the scan is complete.
5. If you wish to scan a page again, refresh it first.

*There is a "open_test_sites.bat" file that can be run to open the list of 22 testing sites. This will slow your computer and take a while for all sites to load. Manually edit the file to reduce the number of sites opened.*
